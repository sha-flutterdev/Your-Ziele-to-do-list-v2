<p align="justify">In this mini project, we have chosen to built a to-do list application which is designed as a website at first and then it is developed as a mobile application named as “Your Ziele”. Ziele is derived from German language which means goals, targets, objectives and aim. Your Ziele is smart task list for everyday use. It is truly usable with great user experience. It helps you in focus on really important things and you will be better organized.By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.</p>

<h1 align="left">What features we have introduced in Your Ziele?</h1>

<h2 align="left">1.	User-friendly:</h2>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83126866/123594072-de8e3180-d80c-11eb-8652-e543ab6257a5.png"> </p>

•	User-friendly navigation, supported with slight eye-pleasing animation, will help users to focus on their tasks.  
  
•	No ads, no complications, no extra copy, interface motivating to create short concise notes for the tasks – nothing will distract from the goals.
  
•	The application allows saving notes conveniently, check stats and plan anything from everyday stuff to business objectives.

  </ol>

<h2 align="left">2.	Local Storage Supported:</h2>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83126866/123594606-8c99db80-d80d-11eb-8ffe-fd0a5519739a.png"> </p>
 
<p align="justify">After storing your data, eventually you will need to access it and each storage method has slightly different levels of accessibility. Local storage is accessible in any window or tab that is open to your site. This means if you store some data in local storage on one tab of your browser that same local storage data will be available on all other tabs and windows you have open to that site.</p>

<h2 align="left">3.	Authentic Splash screen:</h2>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83126866/123597234-b3a5dc80-d810-11eb-9a96-9d989c88a2b4.png"> </p>

<ol>
  
•	Splash screens help reduce user anxiety around waiting. 
  
•	They make the wait feel shorter, giving users confidence that the app is still loading and sometimes giving real-time feedback to let them know how long it will take.
  
•	They are considered as a source for brand strengthening and start out the app loading process  in order to give the user a better experience.
  
•	Additionally, this gives an insight to the client that any android application development services will be propelled very soon (a sign that it won’t crash, rather start).
  
 </ol>


<h2 align="left">4.	Displays current Date and Time:</h2>
