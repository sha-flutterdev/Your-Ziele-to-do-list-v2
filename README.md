In this mini project, we have chosen to built a to-do list application which is designed as a website at first and then it is developed as a mobile application named as “Your Ziele”. Ziele is derived from German language which means goals, targets, objectives and aim. Your Ziele is smart task list for everyday use. It is truly usable with great user experience. It helps you in focus on really important things and you will be better organized.By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.
